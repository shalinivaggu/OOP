**Object Oriented Programming in Java**

OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which can hold both data and behavior.

An object = data (fields/attributes) + methods (functions/behavior).

OOP helps make your code:
Modular
Reusable
Easier to maintain
Scalable

🎯 Four Pillars of OOP 

| Pillar            | Status  | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | ✅ Done  | Wrapping data and restricting direct access using `private` and `getters/setters` |
| **Abstraction**   | ⏳ Next  | Hiding internal complexity and showing only essential features                    |
| **Inheritance**   | ⏳ Later | Acquiring properties and behavior from parent class                               |
| **Polymorphism**  | ⏳ Later | One interface, many forms (method overloading/overriding)                         |

🔐 Pillar 1: Encapsulation
✅ Definition
Encapsulation is the process of binding data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to it.

✅ Achieved in Java by:
Declaring class variables as private

Providing public getters and setters

✅ Benefits:
Data hiding and protection
Controlled access
Validation logic can be added
Clean, maintainable, modular code
